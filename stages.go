// PipelineStage is the interface used to process data at a certain step
// within a Pipeline. The Pipeline is responsible for passing data between
// each stage, and each stage will receive data in it's HandleData function.
//
// When the stage is finished handling it's current data payload, it should send
// the new Data on the outputChan to the next stage.
//
// If an unexpected error occurs, it can be sent to the killChan to halt
// pipeline execution.

	// and won't be sending any more data. So, Finish() will be be called after
	// the last call to HandleData().

	// *Note: If the PipelineStage instance receiving the Finish() call is the last
	// stage in the pipeline, outputChan will be nil.*
